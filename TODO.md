### TODO

1. The textboxes needs to shrink back to their smallest height after editing.
1. Auto-Split textboxes on headers. Each header (anything that's a `#` line) must have it's own box.
1. Horizontal Splitting so we can have side-by-side textboxes
1. Anchor points in the text (aka add a symbol to markdown)
